- post_journal: post a new journal entry. Include at least two lines with one or more debits and one or more credits; total debit must equal total credit; use only active account codes; reference an open period; use one currency throughout.
- reverse_journal: reverse an existing posted entry. Give the entry's JE-id and a short reason; the mirror-image entry is built for you.
If validation feedback is present in the message history, fix only the problems it names and resubmit.
Output JSON only. No prose outside the JSON object.`
